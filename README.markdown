2013-03-26: I haven't had much attention for this over the last year (can't
believe it's been that long), but it's still on the list of things I'd like
to work on.  I'm trying to make some progress with it now.

2012-01-15: First set of backups run using this code.  These were done in
via the tests, but did simulate a full (but small) backup data-set.  This
is a good indicator that the heart of the backup code is complete, but
there is a lot of other accessory code that still needs to be put in place.

2011-12-31: Currently, this software is under development.  Development
should be fairly rapid, as it is a next-generation implementation of a
version currently in production internally at tummy.com, ltd.
