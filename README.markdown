2012-01-15: First set of backups run using this code.  These were done in
via the tests, but did simulate a full (but small) backup data-set.  This
is a good indicator that the heart of the backup code is complete, but
there is a lot of other accessory code that still needs to be put in place.

2011-12-31: Currently, this software is under development.  Development
should be fairly rapid, as it is a next-generation implementation of a
version currently in production internally at tummy.com, ltd.
