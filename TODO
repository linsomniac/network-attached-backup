Re-organize storage objects so they can take database objects rather than
      hostname/snapshotname?  Do they also need to take "db" then?

initdb test needs to detect if the initdb has worked, it currently does
not.  This probably needs to be done by closing and re-opening the database
connection.  I don't know if that's even possible with the current code.

Tests for "nab newserver".
